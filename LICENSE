This implementation is based on the original RetroUI React component library:

The original RetroUI project provided the design inspiration, component concepts, 
and visual styling that this vanilla JavaScript implementation is based upon.
This vanilla version was created to provide the same retro gaming aesthetic 
without requiring React, build tools, or dependencies.

The classless/semantic HTML approach is inspired by PicoCSS:

PicoCSS demonstrated the elegant philosophy of styling semantic HTML without classes,
which we've applied to retro gaming interfaces.
